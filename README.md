# Comparing Garlic and Leek prices in Major Superstores of Canada

## Overview

This project analyzes the average prices of garlic and leeks from June 2024 to November 2024 in Canadaâ€™s major superstores. We aim to identify pricing trends, rank vendors from most to least expensive, and evaluate the cost evolution over time.

The paper for this project can be found [here](paper/paper.pdf).
