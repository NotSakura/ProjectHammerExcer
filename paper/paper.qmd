#Source of Bias
When comparing the prices across different vendors such as Walmart, Loblaws, Metro and T&T, Regional pricing and the variety of products introduces significant sources of bias and these could impact the analysis. Regional pricing can raise variations in transport costs, local supply and demand, and regional supplier agreements. For example, the prices of garlic can differ between urban and rural areas, which in turn may provide a certain vendor with an appearance of being more expensive because of the regions they are operating within in the dataset. Product variety further complicates the comparison in that different vendors may offer different types of garlic, such as organic, imported, or bulk varieties. These usually come at different prices, and this may skew average price comparisons if one vendor sells mostly premium or bulk garlic while another focuses on standard, single-head garlic. These biases may well be overcome by comparing the prices in similar regions and types of garlic, where possible, to give a more balanced and objective analysis of pricing for each of the vendors.
