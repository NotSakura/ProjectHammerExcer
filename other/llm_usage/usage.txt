I have a table in sqllite3 database, how to export to csv

You can export a table from an SQLite3 database to a CSV file using either the SQLite command line or through Python. Here are both methods:

1. Using the SQLite Command Line
If you have access to the SQLite command line, you can run the following commands:

sqlite3 your_database.db
Then within the SQLite shell, enter:

.headers on
.mode csv
.output your_table.csv
SELECT * FROM your_table;
.output stdout
Replace your_database.db with the name of your database file and your_table with the name of your table.

2. Using Python
If you prefer using Python, you can use the sqlite3 library along with csv to export the table to a CSV file:

import sqlite3
import csv

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect("your_database.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query all data from the table
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")

# Fetch all rows and get column names
rows = cursor.fetchall()
column_names = [description[0] for description in cursor.description]

# Write data to CSV file
with open("your_table.csv", "w", newline="") as csv_file:
    writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
    writer.writerow(column_names)  # Write header
    writer.writerows(rows)  # Write data

# Close the connection
conn.close()
Replace your_database.db and your_table with your database and table names, respectively. This code will create a file named your_table.csv with the contents of your table.





Use SQL (not R or Python) to make some finding using this observational data. Write a short paper using Quarto (you are welcome to use R/Python to make graphs but not for data preparation/manipulation which should occur in SQL in a separate script). In the discussion please have one sub-section each on: 1) correlation vs. causation; 2) missing data; 3) sources of bias.


sqlite> .tables
product  raw    
sqlite> .schema product
CREATE TABLE product (
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	concatted TEXT UNIQUE,
	vendor TEXT,
	product_name TEXT,
	units TEXT,
	brand TEXT,
	detail_url TEXT,
	sku TEXT,	-- The unique product identifier at this ONE vendor
	upc TEXT	-- The universal product code that identifies this product across ALL vendors, may be an actual UPC or a temporary calculated cross-id of some sort
);
sqlite> .schema raw
CREATE TABLE raw (
	nowtime TEXT,
	current_price TEXT,
	old_price TEXT,
	price_per_unit TEXT,
	other TEXT,
	product_id INTEGER);
CREATE INDEX raw_prod_id ON raw ( product_id );


Add product name and vendor  to raw and only keep entries where month is 05

Create a new table for this

You can create a new table that includes the product name and vendor from the product table and keeps only the entries where the month is May (05) using the following SQL script. This script will add the necessary columns from the product table and filter entries based on the specified month:

-- Create a new table for analysis, joining product and raw tables and filtering for month 05
CREATE TABLE may_product_data AS
SELECT 
    r.nowtime,
    r.current_price,
    r.old_price,
    r.price_per_unit,
    r.other,
    p.product_name,
    p.vendor,
    p.units,
    p.brand,
    p.sku,
    p.upc
FROM 
    raw r
JOIN 
    product p ON r.product_id = p.id
WHERE 
    strftime('%m', r.nowtime) = '05';
This script joins the raw table with the product table on product_id, which links specific product entries in raw with their metadata in product. It filters the records so only entries from May (05) are included in the new table, may_product_data. This table will contain the relevant data for further analysis.

Quarto Outline
Findings Analysis in Quarto

Introduction: Describe the data sources (product and raw tables) and the purpose of the analysis, emphasizing the May-filtered subset.
Results: Use SQL to explore various analyses, such as:
Average price trends by vendor and product.
Price changes (current_price vs. old_price) and their frequency.
Visualizations: Use R or Python for visualizations (e.g., price trends, frequency distributions).
Discussion

Correlation vs. Causation: Discuss potential relationships observed (e.g., price changes over time, vendor-specific price patterns) and caution against inferring causation without a controlled study.
Missing Data: Analyze the extent of missing fields, particularly in price data, and the potential impact on analysis accuracy.
Sources of Bias: Identify biases in observational data, like vendor-specific products or non-standardized pricing dates, which could skew results.
This approach ensures all data preparation is performed in SQL, while visual analysis and discussion happen in Quarto with support from R/Python graphics libraries if needed. Let me know if youâ€™d like any specific analysis examples or if you want to explore additional findings!
